# Single_Cell_Analysis_Pipeline
Single Cell RNASeq analysis script for marker based filtering of rare cell types prior to clustering. In this example I apply it to characterising rare but previously identified NK myeloid cells that were described in a pan-cancer analysis of human NK cells. I apply a similar filtering approach to mouse NK cells.
